# facemask_detection_project
A project for Shapeai firm after being trained for the position of Data Analyst.
COVID-19 face mask detector training accuracy/loss curves demonstrate high accuracy and little signs of overfitting on the data. Weâ€™re now ready to apply our knowledge of computer vision and deep learning using Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow/Keras to perform face mask detection.
